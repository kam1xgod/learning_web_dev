## Overview

### Why?

Web development is simply interesting. It's the only one way to provide your product, thoughts, personality or even life in internet. Isn't that cool? Not really. I learn it because I love designing things in my way. I love CSS for this. In web development, for my opinion, you are some kind of artist.

### Progress

But from time to time I really will write here some progress. Especially if my last work was hard enough or interesting at some point.
