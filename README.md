## Overview

### Why?

Web development is simply interesting. It's the only one way to provide your product, thoughts, personality or even life in internet. Isn't that cool? Not really. I learn it because I love designing things in my way. I love CSS for this. In web development, for my opinion, you are some kind of artist.
